# Lab: DjangoX

## Overview

It is quite common to set up your Django projects the same way every time.

Some of those common tasks are...

- Create a custom user
- Configure static assets
- Add authentication
- Set up styling
- Install common libraries
- Wire up 3rd party development tools

Repeating these steps over and over violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. So pro developers usually create a skeleton application they use to start off their projects.

Luckily for us, there's already a great example of such a skeleton - [DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox){:target="_blank"}

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

You have two choices:

### Choice 1

- Create a website using your own custom template.
  - Click the `Use this template` button on home page of your own template repository.
- Name your repo whatever you like.
- Create a Django app of your choosing.
- The specific functionality of the site is up to you but should have a model that makes use of `get_user_model`

### Choice 2

- Create a website using DjangoX as a template.
  - Click the `Use this template` button on home page of DjangoX repository.
- Name your repo whatever you like.
